================================================================================

  ZERO SIEVERT DEVELOPMENT TEAM
  -----------------------------
  Thank you for your continued dedication to improving mod support. The
  expanded modding API, documentation, and community engagement have made
  projects like DREAD possible. Your willingness to listen to modders and
  implement requested features shows a genuine commitment to your community.
  We're excited to see where Zero Sievert goes from here.

  FAMILY & FRIENDS
  ----------------
  To my family - thank you for your patience during the late nights of
  coding, debugging, and "just one more feature." Your support means
  everything.

  To my friends - thanks for being willing guinea pigs, for the feedback
  (even the brutal honesty), and for making this journey fun. You know
  who you are.

                            INSPIRATION
================================================================================

  SAIN Mod (SPT-AKI / Escape from Tarkov)
  ---------------------------------------
  The archetype system in DREAD was inspired by SAIN's approach to AI
  personality and behavior variety. While Zero Sievert's API doesn't allow
  for the same depth of AI modification, we adapted the concept into our
  archetype system to bring similar variety to encounters.

================================================================================
                             COMMUNITY
================================================================================

  To everyone who downloads, plays, and provides feedback - thank you for
  giving this mod a chance. Your bug reports, suggestions, and zone
  coordinate contributions help make DREAD better for everyone.

  Special thanks to the Zero Sievert modding Discord for being a helpful
  and welcoming community.
