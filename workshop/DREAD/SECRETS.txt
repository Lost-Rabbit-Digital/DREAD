                         YOU FOUND THE SECRET FILE!
================================================================================

Hey there, curious explorer!

If you're reading this, you've done what every good stalker does - poked around
in places you weren't supposed to. We respect that.

Here's a few secrets for your troubles:

  * The "GigaChad" archetype was named after a particularly brutal playtest
    session where one bandit wiped an entire squad. He earned that title.

  * The invasion wave system was inspired by those moments in Tarkov when
    you think you're safe... and then you're very much not safe.

  * "DREAD" was almost called "SPAWN" but that sounded too much like a
    90s comic book character.

  * There's a 3% chance for "anomalous" enemies in Chaos Mode. That means
    you might see a Watcher General in the Forest. Good luck with that.
